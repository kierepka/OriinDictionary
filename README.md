You can check how project is working here: [ORIIN.ga](https://oriin.ga) (AMAZON AWS free hosting EC2)

This is a project that uses Blazor to connect to a Python backend. The goal of the project is to create a dictionary of base words (at the beginning base words are only in Polish, but the system is self-adapting to different base languages).

The main assumptions are:
1) Cascade security system and permissions
2) The ability to quickly edit words
3) The ability to create a mini WiKi from the dictionary
